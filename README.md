## Data Science Specialization Capstone Project

The data for this project was part of Round 6 of the [Yelp Dataset Challenge](http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge), which consists of information about businesses from 10 cities in 4 countries and includes:
* Over 1.5M reviews by 366K users for 61K businesses, and
* Over 481K business attributes such as hours, parking, ambience, etc.

The primary question of interest that I chose for this project was to attempt to identify drivers of restaurant failure (i.e., predictors of restaurants that are no longer in business) using Yelp data.
